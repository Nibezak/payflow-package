# Welcome to Payflow!

::: danger Beta Release
Although many Payflow sites have been launched using v1.x, you may not consider this version production-ready for your own
use and should exercise the same amount of caution as you would with any software in an beta state. ðŸš€
:::

We are delighted you are considering Payflow for your project. We've spent a lot of time developing this package to bring headless e-commerce functionality to Laravel.

## What is Payflow?

Payflow is a [Laravel e-commerce package](https://payflowphp.io/) which brings functionality akin to Shopify and other e-commerce platforms to Laravel. You have complete freedom to create your own storefront(s), but we've already done the hard work for you in the backend.

## Tech Stack

Payflow is comprised of two packages; `payflowphp/core` which provides the e-commerce functionality and `payflowphp/admin` which provides an admin hub built upon Laravel Livewire.

Although the admin hub uses Laravel Livewire, there is no requirement for your app to use Livewire itself.

## What are the future plans?

Payflow as a company has grand plans to continue developing new functionality to help you build awesome e-commerce websites. We want Payflow to be a true alternative to the likes of Magento, Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.

## Get started

Enough waffle! Let's help you [install Payflow...](/core/installation)
