# Introduction

::: danger Beta Release
Although many Payflow sites have been launched using v1.x, you may not consider this version production-ready for your own
use and should exercise the same amount of caution as you would with any software in an beta state. ðŸš€
:::

Payflow's admin panel is powered by Filament v3. It allows you to easily extend the admin panel to suit your project.

With the panel you can administer your products, collections, orders, customers, discounts, settings and much more.

## Contributing
